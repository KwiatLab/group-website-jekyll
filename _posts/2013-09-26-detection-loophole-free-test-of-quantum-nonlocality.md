"Detection-Loophole-Free Test of Quantum Nonlocality, and Applications." DOI: [10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.130406](http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.130406). We used a source of entangled photons to violate a Bell inequality free of the "fair-sampling" assumption. This work was selected as an Editor's Suggestion and was [featured in Physics](http://physics.aps.org/synopsis-for/10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.130406).
