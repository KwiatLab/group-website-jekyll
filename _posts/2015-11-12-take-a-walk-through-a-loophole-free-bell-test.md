Congratulations to graduate students Brad Christensen and Michael Wayne, former undergraduate Daniel Kumor, and researchers from NIST and several other institutions, who have used entangled photons in a loophole-free Bell test. We also thank graduate student Kristina Meier and undergraduates Joseph Chapman and Malhar Jere. Take a walk through the experiment in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm058yc18hY), and read more:
