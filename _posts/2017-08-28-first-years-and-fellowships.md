We welcome first years Colin Lualdi and Dalton Chaffee to the group! Dalton was awarded the [NASA Space Technology Research Fellowship](https://www.nasa.gov/strg/nstrf) in April 2017, which is awarded to graduate students "who show significant potential to contribute to NASA's goal of creating innovative new space technologies." Colin was awarded both an NSF GRFP fellowship and a College of Engineering [SURGE Fellowship](https://engineering.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/diversity-programs/surge.html). Congratulations!
