We demonstrated a [source]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/#sources-of-entanglement) that produces pure heralded single photons and polarization-entangled pairs without unwanted spectral correlations. Former graduate student Kevin Zielnicki is the lead author: ["Engineering of near-IR photon pairs to be factorable in space-time and entangled in polarization" in *Optics Express*](http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/OE.23.007894).
