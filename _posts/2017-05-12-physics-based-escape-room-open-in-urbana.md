Professor S. has gone missing. Four government agents have disappeared. Can you solve the mystery, save the free world, and maybe learn something too? The world's first [science-based escape room](http://labescape.org) is now open in Urbana, IL, a physics outreach project developed by Professor Paul Kwiat with support from the [American Physical Society](http://www.aps.org/) and [Physics Illinois](http://physics.illinois.edu/).
