#Maintaining the Kwiat group website with Jekyll
##Introduction

The Kwiat group website is maintained using Jekyll. This guide contains an overview of how Jekyll generates the site, and instructions for specific tasks like adding news posts or editing the navbar. For more details about Jekyll, read the Jekyll documentation here: http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/

###But first, wait! Don't edit those HTML files on the server!

Seriously, don't do it. All will be explained! But basically, the way this works is that if you want to change something on the website, you're going to:

1. Edit a file in this GitHub directory
2. Run Jekyll
3. Copy the files generated by Jekyll to the server that hosts the website

If you edit the HTML files (or any files) that are already on the server, your changes 


What is Jekyll? Jekyll is a tool that takes pieces of content like text files and HTML layouts and builds a website, taking care of tedious things you might otherwise have to do manually (like updating the navbar on each page if you want to add a new link). Another way to accomplish this is by building a dynamic site using PHP or other server-side languages. The advantages of using Jekyll are primarily that you don't need to learn a server-side language, and the site can be hosted anywhere without worrying about whether the host server supports your dynamic content. The whole process of building the website happens on your computer, and the result is a static website that can be uploaded to a server. So while using Jekyll might seem intimidating and take a few hours to learn, it's actually a great way to build a complex website without knowing much more than basic HTML and CSS. You can do it!
