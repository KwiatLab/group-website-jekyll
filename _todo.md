##TO DO

- Layout breaks on iPhone, might be okay on larger screens. Navbar brand and collapsed menu don't fit on same line, so navbar is too big and overlaps text at the top of the page. Collapse brand to abbreviated version on small screens?

- Include links from old website in research text

- Make automatic "alternate shading." Liquid script to take a markdown document, divide it into sections when it finds h1, and apply the bowtie background class to alternating sections
