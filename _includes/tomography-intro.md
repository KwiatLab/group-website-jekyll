#Guide to Quantum State Tomography

Because measurement of a quantum state typically *changes* the state being measured, getting a complete picture of that state requires measurements on many state copies. Quantum state tomography is the process by which a quantum state is reconstructed using measurements on an ensemble of identical quantum states.

This page is intended to be useful to a variety of visitors, from experimental research groups setting up quantum tomography systems, to students learning about the theory of characterizing quantum states. 

We have a collection of background material, as well as a real-time tomography interface which can process experimental data!
