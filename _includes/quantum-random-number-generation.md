Pick a number. Your choice may be hard to guess, but it's far from truly random. Flipping a coin or rolling a die come close to true randomness, but they're slow--and they could be predicted in advance if the exact "launch conditions" of the coin or die were known. Computer algorithms are often used to simulate random numbers when many of them are needed--for example, in an online casino--but imperfect randomness can be disastrous. Clever blackjack players can exploit the fact that virtual card-shufflers don't produce a truly random deck arrangement. A cryptography system that failed to generate truly random keys could be cracked.

Quantum mechanical uncertainty offers a source of truly random numbers. A 50-50 beamsplitter transmits half the light that hits it and reflects the other half. Because light is made up of individual photons, each photon has a 50% chance of being transmitted. The outcome for each photon is completely random and can't be predicted beforehand. A simple quantum random number generator might produce binary numbers by assigning a "0" if a photon is transmitted and a "1" if it is reflected.

The rate of random number generation in such a system is limited by how quickly a single-photon detector saturates and loses the ability to count more photons. We have pursued a different strategy, using fast electronics to record the precise arrival time of each photon. Such a measurement can obtain multiple random bits for each detection event, so that it is possible to exceed the normal limits of quantum random number generation by at least an order of magnitude. We achieved a random number generation rate of 110 MB/s as of April 2010, which [exceeded the previous best rate by a factor of 10](http://physics.illinois.edu/news/story.asp?id=1056).
