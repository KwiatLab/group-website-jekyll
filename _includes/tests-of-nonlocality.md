Quantum mechanics predicts many phenomena at odds with our everyday experience. Entanglement is a remarkable example--each particle in an entangled pair contains information that is totally random, yet perfectly correlated with that of its partner. Entanglement violates local realism--the combined assumptions that objects far apart can't interact instantaneously, and that we can come up with a description of the universe which predicts the outcome of any experiment.

In our lab, we can make a series of measurements on a [source of entangled photons](#sources-of-entanglement) to demonstrate the violation of local realism. This experiment, called a Bell test, validates the quantum mechanical world-view. The illustration above is from ["The Mystery of the Quantum Cakes,"]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.paper-path }}/The Mystery of the Quantum Cakes.pdf) which explains the idea of a Bell test in an intuitive way.

###Loopholes
The catch is that some assumptions go into this experiment, leaving loopholes for local-realistic theories. The two main loopholes are "detection" and "timing." Single-photon detectors are not perfect, and even the best current technology will miss some fraction of incoming photons. To close the detection loophole, this fraction must be small enough to ensure that the photons we didn't detect can't change the outcome. To close the timing loophole, the measurement devices that analyze each photon in an entangled pair must be far enough apart that a signal travelling between them at the speed of light--the fastest that any information can travel--could not change the outcome.

Both of these loopholes have been closed independently, but no experiment has yet been able to close both loopholes at the same time. Groups around the world, including ours, are currently working towards a loophole-free Bell test which would demonstrate quantum non-locality once and for all.
