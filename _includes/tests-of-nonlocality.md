Entanglement is a remarkable example of quantum weirdness. Each particle in an entangled pair contains information that is totally random, yet perfectly correlated with that of its partner. These quantum correlations violate *local realism*, which can be described as two assumptions:

1. Objects that are far apart can't interact instantaneously. (Locality)
2. Physical properties of objects always have definite values, even if those values are unknown to us. (Realism)

In our lab, we can make a series of measurements on a [source of entangled photons](#sources-of-entanglement) to demonstrate the violation of local realism. This experiment is called a Bell test. The illustration above is from ["The Mystery of the Quantum Cakes,"]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.paper-path }}/The Mystery of the Quantum Cakes.pdf) which explains the idea of a Bell test in an intuitive way.

###Loopholes
The catch is that some assumptions go into this experiment, leaving loopholes for local realism. The two main loopholes are "detection" and "timing." Single-photon detectors are not perfect, and even the best ones will miss some fraction of incoming photons. To close the detection loophole, this fraction must be small enough to ensure that the photons we didn't detect can't change the outcome. To close the timing loophole, the measurement devices that analyze each photon in an entangled pair must be far enough apart that a signal traveling between them at the speed of light--the fastest that any information can travel--could not change the outcome.

Both of these loopholes had been closed independently as of 2015. Several experiments, including one by a collaboration between NIST, our group, and several other institutions, first closed both loopholes at the same time in 2015. (See Recent Publications & News, above.)
