###AMO book chapter

This chapter represents the latest summary of both the theoretical foundations of our quantum tomography system and the experimental techiniques used to actually implement that system on photonic qubits. It should be the primary resource for understanding Tomography at the Kwiat lab.

###Outside publications

There is of course a huge body of work that the greater quantum information community has provided us with which has been invaluable. Below we make a partial list of these documents, and encourage anyone who knows of other useful resources to email altepete@uiuc.edu in order to have them added to this page.
