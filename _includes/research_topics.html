#Tests of Nonlocality <a id="tests-of-nonlocality"></a>

Quantum mechanics predicts many phenomena at odds with our everyday experience. Entanglement is a remarkable example—each particle in an entangled pair contains information that is totally random, yet perfectly correlated with that of its partner. Entanglement violates local realism—the combined assumptions that objects far apart can’t interact instantaneously, and that we can come up with a description of the universe which predicts the outcome of any experiment.

In our lab, we can make a series of measurements on a source of entangled photons to demonstrate the violation of local realism. This experiment, called a Bell test, validates the quantum mechanical world-view. The catch is that some assumptions go into this experiment, leaving loopholes for local-realistic theories. There are two main loopholes: detection and timing. Each of these has been closed independently, but no experiment has yet been able to close both loopholes at the same time. Groups around the world, including ours, are currently working towards a loophole-free Bell test which would demonstrate quantum non-locality once and for all.

#Quantum Mechanics & Human Perception

Quantum mechanics describes the interactions of particles like electrons and photons on a submicroscopic scale. These particles can diffract and interfere like waves, and they show strange behavior like entanglement and quantum tunneling. Everything around us is built from these particles, but you won’t find your spoon entangled with your breakfast cereal anytime soon, or see a soccer ball diffract around the net.
Making quantum effects available to direct human perception addresses fundamental questions about how strange quantum rules produce the familiar world around us. It also makes quantum mechanics more accessible to the public and to students. We are investigating quantum effects directly through the human visual system, using a single-photon generation technique developed in our lab.

A challenge in making quantum effects visible to humans is the need to detect small numbers of photons. Rod cells in the human retina respond to single photons, but it is not known whether these signals continue through the visual pathway and lead to the perception of light. Previous studies using attenuated lights have estimated detection thresholds of 1-7 photons with model-fitting methods. Using our single-photon generation technique, it is now possible for the first time to test directly whether humans can see single photons, and to probe visual sensitivity with precise numbers of photons.

The results of single-photon vision studies will inform the design of further experiments to test the predictions of quantum mechanics applied to human vision. We will investigate whether a human observer perceives a difference between a photon in a statistical mixture of two polarization states, and one that is in a quantum superposition of two polarizations. Eventually we hope to demonstrate quantum non-locality with human observers.

#Precision Optical Measurements

This project, in progress, uses the concept of "quantum weak-measurements in pre- and post-selected ensembles" as a measurement tool to amplify the value of a small signal to be measured. The amplification effect was shown previously in an optical experiment; however, the technique was never used to measure an otherwise uncharacterized effect. We have used weak measurements to investigate the recently proposed "spin Hall effect" of light, in which oppositely circularly polarized light beams experience opposite (but tiny) transverse spatial shifts when passing through an air-glass interface at angle. Experimentally, characterizing this effect required a spatial resolution of ~lambda/100, where lambda is the wavelength of the light. With our weak-measurement amplification setup, we achieved displacement resolutions on the order of 1 nm.

#QND Detectors (Past research)

We are working towards realizing the first quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement of the photon number of an optical pulse, which will be a revolutionary and enabling technology in various areas in quantum information processing with photons. These areas include: building controlled quantum logic gates, testing eavesdropping strategies in quantum cryptography, implementing quantum repeaters, making optical pulses with a well-determined number of photons, etc. One of the obstacles in optical quantum information processing is the lack of an appreciable direct photon-photon interaction with which to perform controlled logic operations. Recently, however, it was shown that it is possible to make deterministic two-photon logic gates even with weak nonlinearities. The basic principle is the intensity-dependent cross-phase modulation between two optical beams in a medium possessing third-order (Chi^(3)) optical nonlinearity (Kerr nonlinearity). The key feature is the use of an auxiliary intense classical light beam to interact with the single photons, essentially using the same principle as QND measurements. Unfortunately, even these weak nonlinearities cannot be achieved with conventional methods. A while ago (1996), a method to achieve giant Kerr nonlinearities between two optical signals using a four-level atomic system was suggested, employing the phenomenon of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). Ultra cold Alkali atoms such as Rubidium were used experimentally to confirm this giant nonlinearity about a decade later, but not at the single-photon level. In order to achieve large interaction strengths, the light has to be confined. It was recently shown that Rubidium atoms can be filled into a holey photonic bandgap (PBG) fiber, which basically acts as a waveguide where light travels in the empty central region. EIT was also demonstrated in the atoms confined to the holey PBG fiber, at a very low light level. Our efforts are towards identifying the most promising methods and pursuing them in order to realize the first optical QND measurement.

#Sources of Entanglement

Entanglement, the non-classical, non-local “connection” that can exist between particles, is a fundamental resource for quantum information. We have built and continue to improve one of the world's purest and brightest sources of entangled photons, using the process of spontaneous parametric downconversion in a nonlinear optical crystal.
Our polarization-entanglement source uses two such nonlinear crystals back-to-back. A high-energy ultraviolet pump photon entering one of these crystals has a small (about one in a billion) chance of splitting into two low-energy red photons. The first crystal transforms single horizontally polarized parent photons into two vertically polarized daughter photons; the second transforms single vertically polarized parent photons into two horizontally polarized daughter photons. By sending a superposition of horizontal and vertical light (light at 45 degrees) into these crystals, we obtain a superposition of two horizontal and two vertical downconverted photons: entanglement. In this state, neither photon has any definite polarization at all—but as soon as the polarization of either photon is measured, the polarization of the other is immediately determined, no matter how far away it is.

Practical quantum information systems will require small, cheap sources of entanglement. With this in mind, we are developing a downconversion source that uses a blue semiconductor laser diode (similar to the diode in BlueRay players and the Playstaion 3) to pump a nonlinear crystal. We have also expanded the scope of how photons can be entangled. By focusing a pump laser on nonlinear crystals, we demonstrated the first example of hyperentanglement—photons entangled in every degree of freedom. These photons are entangled in polarization, orbital angular momentum and emission time.

More entanglement isn’t always better for quantum information applications. A downconversion source is typically used to produce photons entangled in polarization, but it may also create unwanted correlations in energy and spatial mode. These correlations can cause heralded single photons to be in a mixed state, preventing the interference between photons from different sources that quantum information applications rely on. Using group velocity matching and a broad bandwidth pump, we are developing a pure source that is brighter than sources that fight unwanted entanglement with spectral filtering.

#Single-photon Source

We are engineering a high-efficiency source of single photons that can be used for quantum information applications including quantum cryptography and optical quantum computing.
Our source is based on spontaneous parametric downconversion of a 355-nm pulsed pump laser, frequency-tripled from a 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser. The UV pump is cycled through a BBO downconversion crystal that is phase-matched to produce a pair of photons: a signal at 702 nm and an idler at 718 nm. The energy of each pump pulse is low, so the average number of photon pairs produced in a pass through the crystal is less than one. We cycle the pump through the crystal several times (“temporal multiplexing”), so despite the low probability of producing a pair on each cycle, there is a high probability that at least one pass has produced a pair.

The daughter photons are entangled, so when we detect the presence of an idler photon, we know with near certainty that a signal photon has also been created. Once we detect an idler photon, we switch the signal photon into a variable delay storage cavity. After we finish cycling the pump though the crystal, we release the stored single photon. This yields a high probability of producing a single photon at a predetermined time while simultaneously minimizing the probability of producing more than one photon.
