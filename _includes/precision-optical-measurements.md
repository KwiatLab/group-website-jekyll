Unlike in classical physics, where measurements can be thought of as independent observations that do not affect the outcome of an experiment, measurements on quantum systems can change the state of the system. In a ["weak" quantum measurement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_measurement), the measured system is linked to the measuring device by only a very weak connection--for example, a small amount of light may "leak" out of an experiment onto a sensor. This allows us to measure the system without disturbing it.

###Measuring tiny angles
Measuring this weak value can also amplify small effects so we can measure them with greater precision. The absolute resolution of the measurement, however, typically remains unchanged compared to a conventional measurement. We are currently experimenting with "recycling" the light that is not measured (for example, the light that does not leak onto a sensor) and repeating the weak measurement many times to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Using a preliminary version of this method, we have increased the signal-to-noise ratio and measured the tilt of a mirror by just 50 picoradians--about three billionths of a degree! If a laser beam changed its direction by 50 picoradians, it would be displaced by less than the width of a human hair after traveling the distance across the continental United States.

###Measuring the spin Hall effect of light
In the past, we have also used weak values to [make the first measurement](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1152697) of the [spin Hall effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_Hall_effect) of light, in which oppositely circularly polarized light beams experience opposite (but tiny) transverse spatial shifts when passing through an air-glass interface at an angle (see animation on left). With our weak-measurement amplification scheme, we achieved displacement resolutions on the order of 1 nm.
