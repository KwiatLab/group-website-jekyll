Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows perfectly secure communication between distant parties. The perfect security of QKD, one of the first classically impossible information protocols to be implemented, relies upon the nonlocal nature of quantum mechanics. Using entangled photons and a low-loss quantum storage system, we realized an improvement to this quantum mechanical protocol through the addition of relativistic constraints. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental realization of an information protocol which simultaneously relies upon both quantum mechanics and special relativity.
