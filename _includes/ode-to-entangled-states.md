###Ode to Entangled States

Photons twins, at birth separated<br>
And yet they remain so well correlated<br>
Their colors, directions and spins syncopated<br>
No wonder these states are so celebrated<br><br>
If that one goes this way, this one goes that<br>
If this one comes early, that one comes late<br>
Like two random roulette wheels, yet somehow both "fixed"<br>
To hit the same number though they're never mixed<br><br>
They drove EPR to say "It's incomplete"<br>
They've got the Bell inequities beat<br>
When factoring primes they allow you to cheat<br>
Who knows what new marvel is next at our feet<br><br>
Just out of reach were problems that dangled<br>
Current attempts to solve them seem wangled<br>
Perhaps what's required is something new-fangled<br>
Enter the states called hyper-entangled
