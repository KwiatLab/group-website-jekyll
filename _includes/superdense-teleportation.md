###Superdense Teleportation

[Quantum teleportation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_teleportation) allows information such as the quantum state of a single photon or atom to be perfectly transferred between two locations without passing through the space between them. It relies on a classical communication channel like an internet connection between the two locations, and therefore does not permit information to be transmitted faster than the speed of light. The two locations must also share some quantum entanglement--for example, one photon each from an entangled pair.

Standard quantum teleportation can only be used reliably to transmit quantum states with two parameters. For more than two, the process becomes probabilistic and only works on a fraction of attempts. Other strategies, such as [remote state preparation](http://arxiv.org/abs/quantph/0307100), can be used to reliably transmit more than two parameters, but they quickly require a large number (growing with the square of the number of parameters) of expensive single-photon detectors and complex measurement techniques.

Superdense teleportation is a scheme that can accomplish reliable transmission of quantum information with fewer resources than remote state preparation. It works by encoding the parameters one wishes to transmit on a special class of quantum states called equimodular states. These states are analogous to points on the surface of a hypertorus.

We have experimentally demonstrated superdense teleportation of a four-parameter state using photons hyperentangled in polarization and spatial mode. (See [sources of entanglement](#sources-of-entanglement) and [multipartite entanglement](#multipartite-entanglement) for more about hyperentangled states.)

In the case of polarization and time bins, we see that system as a prime candidate for deployment in a space-to-earth channel. To that end, we characterized the protocol's performance while simulating in the lab several conditions that would be experienced in the space-to-earth channel. The analysis showed that we should be able to successfully execute this protocol in a space-to-earth channel.
