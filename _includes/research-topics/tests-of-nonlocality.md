Quantum mechanics predicts many phenomena at odds with our everyday experience. Entanglement is a remarkable example—each particle in an entangled pair contains information that is totally random, yet perfectly correlated with that of its partner. Entanglement violates local realism—the combined assumptions that objects far apart can’t interact instantaneously, and that we can come up with a description of the universe which predicts the outcome of any experiment.

In our lab, we can make a series of measurements on a source of entangled photons to demonstrate the violation of local realism. This experiment, called a Bell test, validates the quantum mechanical world-view. The catch is that some assumptions go into this experiment, leaving loopholes for local-realistic theories. There are two main loopholes: detection and timing. Each of these has been closed independently, but no experiment has yet been able to close both loopholes at the same time. Groups around the world, including ours, are currently working towards a loophole-free Bell test which would demonstrate quantum non-locality once and for all.
