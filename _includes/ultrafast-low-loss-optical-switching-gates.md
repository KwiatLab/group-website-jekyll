Many optical experiments, including those conducted in our group, require high-speed low-loss optical switches to route photons through the system. For most applications in our lab, we use low-loss Pockels cells in conjugation with polarized light. These devices rely on the [Pockels effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pockels_effect) to induce birefringence within a crystal with an applied electrical field which enables the polarization manipulation of photons as they travel through the crystal. This, combined with a polarizing beamspiltter at the output, allows one to control whether the photon is sent into the transmitted or reflected path.
  
However, it is challenging to simultaneously achieve low-loss and ultrafast switching rates with Pockels cells as the high voltages required introduce issues that degrade the switching performance, such as crystal heating. Since an ultrafast low-loss optical switch has many applications (e.g., [our time-multiplexed single photon source](http://research.physics.illinois.edu/QI/Photonics/research/#single-photon-sources)), we are investigating the possibility of employing optical nonlinearities to achieve switching rates in the GHz range while maintaining less than 2% transmission loss. Promising techniques include the optical Kerr effect, in which a laser is used to alter birefringence of a nonlinear material in a manner similar to how an external electric field is used to alter the birefringence of a crystal in a Pockels cell.
