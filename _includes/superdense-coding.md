Photon detectors with high efficiencies and low error probabilities are essential for optical quantum computing, scalable quantum information protocols, and fundamental physical studies such as [loophole-free Bell tests](#tests-of-nonlocality). Conventional single-photon detectors, such as avalanche photodiodes (APDs) and photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), only have quantum efficiencies of up to 75% and 10-20%, respectively. 

In contrast, VLPCs (Visible Light Photon Counters) and SSPMs (Solid-state Photomultipliers) are solid-state devices that utilize an avalanche multiplication effect, differing (from each other) only in their wavelength sensitivities. VLPCs are sensitive only in the visible range, while the SSPMs are sensitive from the visible to beyond 10 microns. The figure to the left shows a chip containing several VLPCs, and the custom-built copper block used in our system for cooling the VLPCs with liquid helium.

Both VLPCs and SSPMs feature unique capabilities that APDs and PMTs cannot offer, including high quantum efficiency and photon-number resolution--the ability to count multiple photons that arrive simultaneously. The VLPCs have an inferred internal quantum efficiency of 94% +/- 5% (at 694 nm) and SSPMs 96% +/-3% (at 660 nm). In the past, problems with delivering the light to the detector have limited measured efficiencies to less than 88%. 

We are currently improving these detectors by a) using custom anti-reflection (AR) coatings for the detectors, b) reducing losses and background due to the optical coupling fibers, c) using improved low-noise electronics, and d) incorporating novel cryogenic cooling designs. With these improvements, we have recently achieved a record system efficiency of 91% for a VLPC.
