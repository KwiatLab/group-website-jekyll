Many quantum information applications require entanglement, often in the form of pure, maximally entangled pairs of photons (or other qubits). In [quantum teleportation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_teleportation), for example, the two communicating parties must share a maximally entangled two-qubit state. In practical quantum communication systems, the quality of this shared entanglement might be degraded by transmission through noisy channels, which would affect the performance of the system. Distillation is the process of extracting maximal entanglement from a non-maximally entangled state using only "local operations and classical communication"--things that each party can do on his or her end, while they talk to each other on, say, a telephone. A state is said to be distillable if any maximally entangled states can be extracted in this way.

Quantum systems with more than two parts--for example, more than two photons, or more than two degres of freedom of a single photon--are called multipartite. One interesting property of multipartite systems is that in some cases, it's possible to construct states that are entangled, but from which no maximally entangled pairs can be distilled. Such entanglement is called bound entanglement. Bound-entangled states have recently been experimentally observed in trapped ion systems and simulated in linear optics systems. 

Although these states are clearly unsuitable for direct use in most applications that require maximal entanglement, they have a number of other potential applications in quantum information. One example of a bound-entangled state with a number of interesting features is the four-qubit Smolin state. To study this state, we have built a source (see [Sources of Entanglement](#sources-of-entanglement) for background) which can produce it, using photons entangled in polarization and spatial mode (their distribution in space). The figure on the right shows a few of the possible [Hermite-Gaussian spatial modes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_beam#Hermite-Gaussian_modes) as they would appear in the cross-section of a beam.
