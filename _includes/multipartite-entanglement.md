Many quantum information protocols require two communicating parties (Alice and Bob) to share entanglement, often in the form of pure, maximally entangled pairs. In a future quantum communication network, these entangled pairs might be produced at a central location and distributed to users. The quality of this shared entanglement might be degraded by transmission through noisy channels, which would affect the performance of the system. Before using the resulting noisy entanglement for quantum information tasks, Alice and Bob will want to *distill* it: recover as many maximally entangled pairs as possible using only local operations (they can perform any operations on their respective qubits) and classical communication (they can communicate with each other about operations they perform and measurement outcomes). If they can extract any maximal entanglement this way, the noisy state is said to be distillable.

Distillability offers one example of how entanglement becomes increasingly complex at higher dimensions: all entangled 2&#8855;2 (two-qubit) states and 2&#8855;3 (one qubit and one three-level system) states can be distilled. However, at higher dimensions (more particles or more degrees of freedom per particle) there exist undistillable entangled states. This phenomenon, called bound entanglement, has been observed in trapped ion systems and simulated in linear optics systems. Bound-entangled states are clearly unsuitable for direct use in the most well known quantum information tasks, but they do have a number of other potential applications. More importantly, they are of fundamental interest.

The Smolin state is a four-qubit bound-entangled state. We have built a source (see [Sources of Entanglement](#sources-of-entanglement) for background) to produce this state by encoding qubits on the polarizations and orbital angular momenta of photon pairs. The figure on the right shows how we can use can use these degrees of freedom to define logical 0 and 1 states for the qubits. Once complete, this would be the first true demonstration of bound entanglement in a photonic system.
