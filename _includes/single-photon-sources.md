There are [about a hundred billion photons in a well-lit room](http://scienceblogs.com/builtonfacts/2009/03/05/counting-photons/). To get just one photon, you might imagine dimming a light source until the photons come out one at a time. But light sources such as bulbs, LEDs, lasers, and the sun all have something in common: they emit photons randomly. If you want to predict exactly how many photons will be emitted in one second, the best you can do is to calculate a probability distribution. Even if the source is very dim, it's impossible to guarantee that only one photon will be emitted at a time. In many quantum information experiments, a "photon gun"--a source that really only emits [one photon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fock_state) at a time--would be more useful. Even better, and more challenging to build, is a photon gun that can be fired at will. We are engineering a high-efficiency source of single photons that can be used for quantum information applications including quantum cryptography and optical quantum computing.

Our source is based on spontaneous parametric downconversion of a 355-nm pulsed pump laser (see [Sources of Entanglement](#sources-of-entanglement)). Click the figure on the right to open an animation showing how it works. The UV pump is cycled through a nonlinear ([BBO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barium_borate)) crystal, creating pairs of daughter photons at 702 nm and 718 nm. The energy of each pump pulse is low, so the average number of photon pairs produced in a pass through the crystal is less than one. We cycle the pump through the crystal several times ("temporal multiplexing"), so despite the low probability of producing a pair on each cycle, there is a high probability that at least one pass has produced a pair.

The daughter photons are always produced in pairs, so when we detect the presence of a one daughter photon, we know with near certainty that its partner has also been created. Once we detect one photon, we trap its partner in a variable delay storage cavity, where it bounces between mirrors until we let it out. After we finish cycling the pump though the crystal, we release the stored single photon. This yields a high probability of producing a single photon at a predetermined time while simultaneously minimizing the probability of producing more than one photon--a photon gun that can be fired at will.
