###Can you see a single photon? 
At the lower limit of vision, the eye needs just a few photons. No one knows exactly how few--psychological and physiological research have suggested that single-photon vision may be possible, but the question has never been directly tested. Rod cells in the human retina (see figure on right) respond to single photons, but it is not known whether these signals continue through the visual pathway and lead to the perception of light. All previous studies have used attenuated classical light sources, and have estimated the detection threshold with model-fitting methods.

###Physics and psychology unite!
Working with [University of Illinois psychology professor Dr. Frances Wang](http://www.psychology.illinois.edu/people/wang18), we are conducting several experiments to characterize the lower limit of human vision using a true source of single photons. **If you are interested in participating as a volunteer observer, you can find more information and an interest form <a class="underline" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/vision/">here</a>.**

###Human perception of quantum effects
Demonstrating single-photon vision will not only answer an open question in psychology, but could also make it possible to test the predictions of quantum mechanics in the visual system. On a submicroscopic scale, everything can be described with quantum mechanics. Particles like electrons and photons can diffract and interfere like waves, and they show strange behavior such as entanglement and quantum tunnelling. Everything around us is made of quantum particles, but you won't find your spoon entangled with your breakfast cereal any time soon, or see a soccer ball diffract around the net. Exactly why quantum weirdness seems to disappear in the macroscopic world remains a deep mystery. 

Making quantum effects available to direct human perception addresses fundamental questions about how strange quantum rules produce the familiar world around us. We may be able to investigate whether a human observer perceives a difference between a photon in a statistical mixture of two polarization states, and one that is in a quantum superposition of two polarizations. Eventually we might even be able to demonstrate quantum non-locality in a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/research/#tests-of-nonlocality">Bell test</a> with human observers instead of single-photon detectors.
