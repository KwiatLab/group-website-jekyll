###Can you see a single photon? 
At the lower limit of vision, the eye needs just a few photons. No one knows exactly how few--psychological and physiological research have suggested that single-photon vision may be possible, but the question has never been directly tested. Rod cells in the human retina (see figure on right) respond to single photons, but it is not known whether these signals continue through the visual pathway and lead to the perception of light. All previous studies have used attenuated classical light sources, and have estimated the detection threshold with model-fitting methods.

Working with [University of Illinois psychology professor Dr. Frances Wang](http://www.psychology.illinois.edu/people/wang18), we are conducting several experiments to characterize the lower limit of human vision using a true source of single photons. **If you are interested in participating as a volunteer observer, you can find more information and an interest form <a class="underline" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/vision/">here</a>.**

###Human perception of quantum effects
Demonstrating single-photon vision will not only answer an open question in psychology, but will also make it possible to test the predictions of quantum mechanics applied to human perception. Quantum mechanics describes the interactions of particles like electrons and photons on a submicroscopic scale. These particles can diffract and interfere like waves, and they show strange behavior like entanglement and quantum tunnelling. Everything around us is built from these particles, but you won't find your spoon entangled with your breakfast cereal anytime soon, or see a soccer ball diffract around the net.

Making quantum effects available to direct human perception addresses fundamental questions about how strange quantum rules produce the familiar world around us. It also makes quantum mechanics more accessible to the public and to students.

The results of single-photon vision studies will inform the design of further experiments to test the predictions of quantum mechanics applied to human vision. We will investigate whether a human observer perceives a difference between a photon in a statistical mixture of two polarization states, and one that is in a quantum superposition of two polarizations. Eventually we hope to demonstrate quantum non-locality with human observers.
