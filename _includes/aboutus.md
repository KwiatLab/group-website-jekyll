We are a quantum information research group in the [physics department](http://physics.illinois.edu) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://illinois.edu).

Our research interests include:

* Fundamental studies of quantum mechanics
* Optical quantum information resources including single-photon sources, single-photon detectors, sources of entanglement, quantum random number generators, and adaptive optics
* Applications such as quantum key distribution, quantum state and process tomography, quantum state creation and remote preparation, hyperentanglement-enhanced quantum communication, quantum-enhanced precision measurements, and quantum memory
* The interaction of quantum states of light with biological systems, including the human visual system
