#What is quantum information?

Quantum information is the physics of knowledge. 

Quantum mechanics tells us that how and when something is measured can change the outcome of an experiment. Even stranger, the physical reality of an experiment is affected by the knowledge of the experimenter--or more precisely, by what can in principle be known. 

This inextricable link between reality and information leads to intriguing and fantastic possibilities. Examples include quantum teleportation, by which a quantum state can be delivered to a distant place without travelling through the space between; quantum computers which instantly break encryption codes; information which can never be copied, only moved and changed; and cryptographic techniques whose secrecy is guaranteed by physical laws. Quantum computers can be built on qubits, the quantum analogue of a classical bit. While classical bits can only take the value 0 or 1, a qubit can be in any superposition of 0 *and* 1. The quantum computers of the future could take advantage of this property to be faster than any classical computer at certain tasks.

At the center of quantum information lies the elusive concept of entanglement, which violates the fundamental classical assumption that if you separate two objects in space, what happens to one is independent of the other. Quantum information, in the end, describes not only what can be known, but the subtle effect that knowing has on nature.
