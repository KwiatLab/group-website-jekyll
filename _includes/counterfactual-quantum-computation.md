In a particularly unusual quantum information scheme called "counterfactual computation" (CFC), one can perform a measurement on a quantum computer and obtain information about the solution to a problem without the computer actually running. We demonstrated the first experimental realization of counterfactual computation. In addition to theoretically demonstrating some error-suppressing capabilities of a non-running quantum computer, we proposed a scheme which showed an apparent breakdown of the previously established bounds on how good of a CFC one can achieve. This initiated an ongoing debate on the meaning of counterfactuality in quantum processes.
