If you were to set a classical pot of water on a stovetop and watch it, it would eventually boil; however that wouldn't be the case with a quantum pot. The quantum Zeno effect is the paradoxical phenomena that you can "freeze" a quantum state in its current configuration by repeatedly measuring it, i.e. once a quantum state is measured and assumes a definite state, you can prevent it from evolving beyond that definite state by constantly projecting it back via measurement.



We are experimentally demonstrating the quantum Zeno effect by showing that there will be less state decay when repeated, projective measurements are introduced to a decaying system, compared to when no measurements are present. In doing so, we can potentially learn more about using the idea of measurement to limit the severity of state decay when transmitting quantum states.



To get an idea of how we are demonstrating the effect, consider the following example: 



Suppose we have a beam of light that traverses space and hits a target.

If we add some pieces of refractive material throughout the path, the spatial mode of this beam will gradually evolve from it's original position. After a sufficient number of perturbations, it will no longer hit the target!

Now suppose we center a pinhole in the location of the unperturbed beam after the first refractive slab. Although the beam has evolved beyond its original position, a little bit of light will pass through the pinhole and will be projected back to its initial spatial state! If we repeatedly project the spatial mode of the beam back to its original state, a fraction of the original light will eventually hit the target. Hence, the quantum Zeno effect!
