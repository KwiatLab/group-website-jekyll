If you were to set a classical pot of water on a stovetop and watch it, it would eventually boil; however that wouldn't be the case with a quantum pot. The quantum Zeno effect is the phenomena that you can "freeze" a quantum state in its current configuration by repeatedly measuring it, i.e. once a quantum state is measured and assumes a definite state, you can prevent it from evolving beyond that definite state by constantly projecting it back via measurement.

We are experimentally demonstrating the quantum Zeno effect by showing that there will be less quantum state decay when repeated measurements are introduced to a system, compared to when no measurements are present. In doing so, we can potentially learn more about using the idea of measurement to limit the severity of state decay when transmitting quantum states.
