I"Æ<p>We demonstrated a <a href="/QI/Photonics/research/#sources-of-entanglement">source</a> that produces pure heralded single photons and polarization-entangled pairs without unwanted spectral correlations. Former graduate student Kevin Zielnicki is the lead author: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/OE.23.007894">â€œEngineering of near-IR photon pairs to be factorable in space-time and entangled in polarizationâ€ in <em>Optics Express</em></a>.</p>
