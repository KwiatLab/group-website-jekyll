# List of pages to include in navbar. Links will appear in order from left to right.
# url for each page MUST match its actual location relative to /_site, which is controlled by, among other things, the permalink setting in _config.yml.
# In the generated navbar, child_links will go to navbar_link.url#{{ child_link.name | handleize }} unless child_link.url is specified, in which case child_links go to child_link.url. 
# Child link titles under Research must exactly match names of markdown files to be included in research.html. If an HTML file is to be included instead, add "html: yes" under the child link. An HTML file with the same name 
# Headers (appearing above) and dividers (appearing below) can be added to child_links:
#     - name: "Counterfactual Quantum Computation"
#      id: "Counterfactual-Quantum-Computation"
#      header: "Quantum Computing"
#      divider: ""
