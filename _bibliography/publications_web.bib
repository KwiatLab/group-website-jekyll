 abstract = {Quantum teleportation faces increasingly demanding requirements for transmitting large or even entangled systems. However, knowledge of the state to be transmitted eases its reconstruction, resulting in a protocol known as remote state preparation. A number of experimental demonstrations to date have been restricted to single-qubit systems. We report the remote preparation of two-qubit "hybrid" entangled states, including a family of vector-polarization beams. Our single-photon states are encoded in the photon spin and orbital angular momentum. We reconstruct the states by spin-orbit state tomography and transverse polarization tomography. The high fidelities achieved for the vector-polarization states opens the door to optimal coupling of down-converted photons to other physical systems, such as an atom, as required for scalable quantum networks, or plasmons in photonic nanostructures.},

Here we present an alternative "direct characterization of quantum dynamics" (DCQD) algorithm. In contrast to all known QPT methods, this algorithm relies on error-detection techniques and does not require any quantum state tomography. We illustrate that, by construction, the DCQD algorithm can be applied to the task of obtaining partial information about quantum dynamics. Furthermore, we argue that the DCQD algorithm is experimentally implementable in a variety of prominent quantum-information processing systems, and show how it can be realized in photonic systems with present day technology.},

@article{Hosten2006,
 abstract = {The logic underlying the coherent nature of quantum information processing often deviates from intuitive reasoning, leading to surprising effects. Counterfactual computation constitutes a striking example: the potential outcome of a quantum computation can be inferred, even if the computer is not run. Relying on similar arguments to interaction-free measurements (or quantum interrogation), counterfactual computation is accomplished by putting the computer in a superposition of 'running' and 'not running' states, and then interfering the two histories. Conditional on the as-yet-unknown outcome of the computation, it is sometimes possible to counterfactually infer information about the solution. Here we demonstrate counterfactual computation, implementing Grover's search algorithm with an all-optical approach. It was believed that the overall probability of such counterfactual inference is intrinsically limited, so that it could not perform better on average than random guesses. However, using a novel 'chained' version of the quantum Zeno effect, we show how to boost the counterfactual inference probability to unity, thereby beating the random guessing limit. Our methods are general and apply to any physical system, as illustrated by a discussion of trapped-ion systems. Finally, we briefly show that, in certain circumstances, counterfactual computation can eliminate errors induced by decoherence.},

The spin Hall effect can be used for manipulating photonic angular momentum states, and the measurement technique holds promise for precision metrology.},

In particular, heralded single-photon sources via spontaneous parametric-down conversion (SPDC) have been a key technology for demonstrating small-scale QIP, yet their low generation efficiency is a critical limitation to furthering the scale-up of optical QIP technology. In order to efficiently overcome the probabilistic nature of SPDC, here we demonstrate time multiplexing for up to 30 time slots of a periodically pumped heralded single-photon source using a switchable low-loss optical storage cavity. We observe a maximum single-photon probability of 38.6±0.4{%} in periodic output time windows, corresponding to ∼6 times enhancement over a nonmultiplexed source but with no increase in the contribution of unwanted multiphoton events. Combining this time-multiplexing technique with a heralded source producing pure single-photon states should enable larger-scale optical QIP systems than previously realized.},

The heralding photon is in the near IR, close to the peak detection efficiency of off-the-shelf Si single-photon detectors; meanwhile, the heralded photon is in the telecom L-band where fiber losses are at a minimum. We observe spectral factorability of the SPDC source and consequently high purity (90{%}) of the produced heralded single photons by several different techniques.

 abstract = {Entangled states are central to quantum information processing, including quantum teleportation, efficient quantum computation and quantum cryptography. In general, these applications work best with pure, maximally entangled quantum states. However, owing to dissipation and decoherence, practically available states are likely to be non-maximally entangled, partially mixed (that is, not pure), or both. To counter this problem, various schemes of entanglement distillation, state purification and concentration have been proposed. Here we demonstrate experimentally the distillation of maximally entangled states from non-maximally entangled inputs. Using partial polarizers, we perform a filtering process to maximize the entanglement of pure polarization-entangled photon pairs generated by spontaneous parametric down-conversion. We have also applied our methods to initial states that are partially mixed. After filtering, the distilled states demonstrate certain non-local correlations, as evidenced by their violation of a form of Bell's inequality. Because the initial states do not have this property, they can be said to possess 'hidden' non-locality.},

While heralded single-photon sources (HSPSs) using nonlinear optical processes have enabled proof-of-principle demonstrations in this area of research, they are not scalable as their probabilistic nature severely limits their generation efficiency. We overcome this limitation by demonstrating a substantial improvement in HSPS efficiency via large-scale time multiplexing. Using an ultra-low loss, adjustable optical delay to multiplex 40 conventional HSPS photon generation processes into each operation cycle, we have observed a factor of 9.7(5) enhancement in efficiency, yielding a 66.7(24)\% probability of collecting a single photon with high indistinguishability (90\%) into a single-mode fiber per cycle. We also experimentally investigate the trade-off between a high single-photon probability and unwanted multiphoton emission. Upgrading our time-multiplexed source with state-of-the-art HSPS and single-photon detector technologies will enable the generation of \&gt;30 coincident photons with unprecedented efficiency.},

In this paper, we compare six different techniques that yield either a characterization of the joint spectral intensity or of the closely related purity of heralded single photons. These six techniques include: (i) scanning monochromator measurements, (ii) a variant of Fourier transform spectroscopy designed to extract the desired information exploiting a resource-optimized technique, (iii) dispersive fibre spectroscopy, (iv) stimulated-emission-based measurement, (v) measurement of the second-order correlation function g(2) for one of the two photons, and (vi) two-source Hong–Ou–Mandel interferometry. We discuss the relative performance of these techniques for the specific cases of a SPDC source designed to be factorable and SFWM sources of varying purity, and compare the techniques’ relative advantages and disadvantages. }

Typical single-photon generation techniques based on nonlinear parametric processes face challenges of probabilistic generation.

Our low-loss optical memories greatly enhance (\&\#x223C;30\&\#x00D7;) the generation rate of coincidence photons from two independent sources, while maintaining high indistinguishability (95.7\&\#x00B1;1.4\%) of the synchronized photons. As an application, we perform the first demonstration of parametric-source-based measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution. The synchronization technique demonstrated here paves the way toward efficient quantum communication and larger-scale optical quantum computing.},

We present a technique that uses a genetic algorithm to control a deformable mirror for correcting wavefront aberrations in single-photon signals from point emitters. We apply our technique to both a simulated point source and a real InAs quantum dot, achieving coupling increases of up to 50\% and automatic reduction of system drift.},

abstract = {We report on the generation of an indistinguishable heralded single-photon state, using highly nondegenerate spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC). Spectrally factorable photon pairs can be generated by incorporating a broadband pump pulse and a group-velocity matching (GVM) condition in a periodically-poled potassium titanyl phosphate (PPKTP) crystal. The heralding photon is in the near IR, close to the peak detection efficiency of off-the-shelf Si single-photon detectors; meanwhile, the heralded photon is in the telecom L-band where fiber losses are at a minimum. We observe spectral factorability of the SPDC source and consequently high purity (90\%) of the produced heralded single photons by several different techniques. Because this source can also realize a high heralding efficiency (\&gt; 90\%), it would be suitable for time-multiplexing techniques, enabling a pseudo-deterministic single-photon source, a critical resource for optical quantum information and communication technology.},

abstract = {Photons have proven to be excellent carriers of quantum information and play essential roles in numerous quantum information processing (QIP) applications. In particular, heralded single-photon sources via spontaneous parametric-down conversion (SPDC) have been a key technology for demonstrating small-scale QIP, yet their low generation efficiency is a critical limitation to furthering the scale-up of optical QIP technology. In order to efficiently overcome the probabilistic nature of SPDC, here we demonstrate time multiplexing for up to 30 time slots of a periodically pumped heralded single-photon source using a switchable low-loss optical storage cavity. We observe a maximum single-photon probability of 38.6\&\#xB1;0.4\% in periodic output time windows, corresponding to \&\#x223C;6 times enhancement over a nonmultiplexed source but with no increase in the contribution of unwanted multiphoton events. Combining this time-multiplexing technique with a heralded source producing pure single-photon states should enable larger-scale optical QIP systems than previously realized.},
