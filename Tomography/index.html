	This website, maintained by 
	<a href="http://research.physics.illinois.edu/QI/Photonics/">
	Paul Kwiat's quantum information group
	</a>, is intended to be useful to a variety of visitors.
	First and foremost, it is meant to provide a practical
	starting point for experimental groups setting up quantum
	tomgraphy systems.  Secondly, we believe the information here
	can act as an introduction to quantum tomography for those
	just learning about the subject.  Lastly, we think that even
	experienced researchers in the field may find some tips and
	tricks that we use helpful.  No matter who you, are, we
	would like to welcome you to our website.  The website will
	continue to grow as we learn new things and as we have time
	to flush out the material already here.

		What is Tomography?
	</h2>
	<p>
	Quantum state tomography is the process by which a quantum
	state is reconstructed using measurements on an ensemble of
	identical quantum states.  Because measurement of a quantum
	state (in general) <i>changes</i> the state being measured,
	getting a complete picture of that state requires 
	measurements on many state copies.

	<p>
	This site is organized into two major sections.  
	<a href="tomography_theory/index.html">
	Tomography Theory
	</a> contains the theoretical foundations necessary for
	tomography, information about the specific systems that we
	use, and the modifications, measurements, and data
	processing that are necessary to perform a real,
	experimental tomography.  (Most of this information is
	contained in a large book chapter available for download.)
	<a href="tomography_code/index.html">
	Tomography Code
	</a> contains all of the Matlab code that we use
	to analyze our data, with descriptions of some of the most
	important functions.
<br>
  A <a href="http://webusers.physics.uiuc.edu/~tomowww/TomographyDemo.php"><font size=+2
    color=red>Real-time
    tomography interface</font></a> is also available, the tutorial for running the interface is available <a href="tutorial for tomography.pdf">
	here</a>.
